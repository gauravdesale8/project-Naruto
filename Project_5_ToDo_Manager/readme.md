# A Task / ToDo Manager (CLI)

* Add Tasks
* List Tasks
* Mark Task As Done
* Save/Load From File

## Step 1: Skeleton First (No Logic Yet)

* Python Logic
* OOPs structure

## Step 2: Menu + Loop (Python Heavy , OOP-light)

* Add a menu
* Use a loop
* Manage multiple tasks
* Still use Task class only as data holder
