# A Task / ToDo Manager (CLI)

* Add Tasks
* List Tasks
* Mark Task As Done
* Save/Load From File

## Step 1: Skeleton First (No Logic Yet)

* Python Logic
* OOPs structure

## Step 2: Menu + Loop (Python Heavy , OOP-light)

* Add a menu
* Use a loop
* Manage multiple tasks
* Still use Task class only as data holder

## Step 3: Mark Task as Done (Tiny OOP Upgrade)

* Mark a task as completed
* Introduce one method in Task
* keep logic mostly in main.py

## Step 4: Save & Load Tasks (Python heavy, OOP-support)

* Task will persist using a file
